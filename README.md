## About:
A PsychoPy experiment designee to see the effects of external stimuli on color perception. For example: exposure to a strong smell beforehand might make a person perceive a color differently.
In this case, we use videos (positive, negative, or neutral) as our external stimuli, and ask the participant to adjust the color of a block to what they think is the perfect shade of gray 
which in an ideal case is the RGB value (128, 128, 128).
