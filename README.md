## About:
This is an experiment interface I made for the Neural Engineering Research Division at Mississippi State University. 
The experiment is designed to see the effects of external stimuli on color perception. For example: exposure to a strong smell beforehand might make a person perceive a shade of Red to be darker than it really is.
In this case, we use videos (positive, negative, or neutral) as our external stimuli, and ask the participant to adjust the color of a block to what they think is the perfect shade of gray 
which in an ideal case is the RGB value (128, 128, 128). We collect the data, and see how far off the participants were from the perfect gray shade and which category of videos caused it.
